# Python for Technical Analysis and Trading Strategies

## Purpose
This repository provides a comprehensive set of tools for traders and investors to perform technical analysis of financial markets using Python.

---

The repository is a collection of Python scripts and modules designed to perform technical analysis of financial markets. Technical analysis is a method used by traders and investors to analyze market data, such as price and volume, to identify trends, patterns, and potential trading opportunities.

The repository includes tools for data retrieval, data preprocessing, and technical analysis. The data retrieval tools enable users to retrieve market data from various sources, such as APIs, CSV files, and databases. The data preprocessing tools are designed to clean, normalize, and transform the data into a format suitable for technical analysis.

The technical analysis tools include a wide range of indicators, such as moving averages, Bollinger Bands, Relative Strength Index (RSI), MACD, and many more. These indicators are used to identify trends, momentum, and overbought/oversold conditions in the market.

The repository also includes modules for backtesting trading strategies and evaluating their performance. These modules allow users to simulate trading strategies using historical market data and evaluate their profitability and risk metrics.

## How to run it
I personally recommend it to run it in a virtual environment, as follows:
1. Open a command prompt or terminal window.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment. You can use the `cd` command to change directories.
3. Enter the following command to create a new virtual environment: `python3 -m venv myenv`, replacing "myenv" with the name you want to give to your virtual environment.
4. Activate the virtual environment by entering the following command (Linux environments): `source myenv/bin/activate`
5. Once the virtual environment is activated, you can install Python packages using `pip` as usual. For example, to install the all the packages, 
you can enter the following command: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
6. Assuming you're on the project's folder, now you can run `python3 main.py`
7. When you're done using the virtual environment, you can deactivate it by entering the following command: `deactivate`
